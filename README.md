# External System Information for Raspberry Pi 5
This is an external system information display for the Raspberry Pi 5. I took inspiration from Conky, and Conky Rings, and thought noticed how convenient it was to have that kind of information, but the one drawback to Conky is that it is only on the homescreen -- This becomes one of your peripherals and is always active.

## Setup:
First of all, you have to make sure that you have the i2c interface on your pi enabled correctly. You have to first go to the main menu, going to preferences, and then clicking on Raspberry Pi Configuration.
